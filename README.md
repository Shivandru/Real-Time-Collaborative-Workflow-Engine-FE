This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# Real-Time-Collaborative-Workflow-Engine-BE

# 🧭 Real-Time Collaborative Workflow Engine — Project Guide

> **Purpose**: This project exists purely for **deep backend learning** using **free, local-first tools**. No paid services. No shortcuts. No fake complexity.

---

## 🎯 Core Goal

Build a **real-time, collaborative workflow system** that behaves like a production SaaS backend while remaining:

* 100% free
* Local-first
* Educational

Primary focus:

* Real-time systems
* Distributed backend concepts
* Event-driven thinking

Secondary focus:

* Practical frontend integration
* Clean architecture
* Long-term maintainability

---

## 🔒 Hard Constraints (Non‑Negotiable)

* 💸 **Zero cost** — no paid services
* ☁️ **No cloud dependencies**
* 🌍 **No custom domain**
* 🧪 **Local simulation only**
* 🧠 **Learning > polish**

If a feature requires money:

> Simulate it locally or remove it.

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack (Locked)

### Backend

* Node.js
* TypeScript
* Express
* MongoDB (local)
* Redis (local)

### Frontend

* React
* WebSocket client
* Server-Sent Events (SSE)

### Infra (Optional, Free)

* Docker
* Docker Compose

---

## 🧠 Architecture Principles

* Domain-first design
* Controllers are thin
* Services contain business logic
* Infrastructure details are isolated
* Visible features justify complexity

> **Rule**: If a system is invisible to the user, it must directly support a visible feature.

---

## 🧩 Domain Model (Core)

* **User**
* **Workspace**
* **Task**
* **ActivityEvent** (immutable)
* **Notification**
* **Job**

These entities evolve — but are never removed.

---

# 🛣️ Roadmap (Milestone‑Locked)

Each phase has **exit criteria**. Do not proceed without meeting them.

---

## 🔹 PHASE 0 — Project Foundation

### Goal

Establish a stable, restart-safe foundation.

### Must Build

* Monorepo structure
* Express + TypeScript setup
* Environment-based config
* MongoDB connection
* Health check endpoint
* Basic authentication

### Forbidden

* Redis
* WebSockets
* SSE
* Background jobs

### Exit Criteria

* App starts reliably
* User + workspace creation works
* Server restarts do not break state

---

## 🔹 PHASE 1 — Domain-First Core (CRUD Done Right)

### Goal

Create a clean domain model with predictable APIs.

### Must Build

* Workspace CRUD
* Task CRUD
* Task assignment
* ActivityEvent persisted for every mutation
* Service-layer architecture

### Forbidden

* Real-time updates
* Redis
* Event buses
* Optimistic UI

### Exit Criteria

* Every mutation creates an ActivityEvent
* APIs are idempotent
* Domain model is clearly explainable

---

## ⚡ PHASE 2 — Real-Time Updates (WebSockets)

### Goal

Understand presence, fan-out, and state sync.

### Must Build

* WebSocket server
* Workspace-based rooms
* Real-time task updates
* Online/offline presence

### Redis Usage

* Presence storage (TTL)
* Pub/Sub for multi-process fan-out

### Forbidden

* SSE
* Job queues

### Exit Criteria

* Multiple tabs stay in sync
* Presence survives refresh
* WebSocket reconnect works

---

## 📡 PHASE 3 — Activity Feed via SSE

### Goal

Implement unidirectional event streaming correctly.

### Must Build

* SSE endpoint per workspace
* Stream ActivityEvents
* Reconnect using last-event-id
* Backfill missed events

### Forbidden

* WebSockets for activity feed
* Redis streams

### Exit Criteria

* Feed resumes after refresh
* No memory leaks
* Missed events replay correctly

---

## 🔄 PHASE 4 — Background Jobs (Visible Impact)

### Goal

Introduce distributed systems safely.

### Visible Features

* Bulk task import
* Workspace duplication
* Export functionality

### Redis Usage

* Job queue
* Retry + backoff
* Job status persistence

### UI Requirement

* Progress indicator
* Failure visibility

### Forbidden

* Silent jobs
* Fire-and-forget logic

### Exit Criteria

* Jobs survive crashes
* Failed jobs are visible
* Progress updates stream to UI

---

## 🔔 PHASE 5 — Notification Fan-Out

### Goal

Design an event-driven notification pipeline.

### Must Build

* Mention notifications
* Multi-tab/device delivery
* Unread counts

### Redis Usage

* Pub/Sub or Streams
* Delivery tracking

### Forbidden

* Direct DB writes from socket layer

### Exit Criteria

* Logical exactly-once delivery
* Badge counts stay consistent
* Redis restarts do not corrupt state

---

## 🧪 PHASE 6 — Production Constraints (Optional)

### Goal

Think like production without over-engineering.

### Must Build

* Rate limiting
* Graceful degradation
* Basic observability

### Forbidden

* Microservices
* Kubernetes-level complexity

### Exit Criteria

* Trade-offs are clearly understood
* Failure modes are documented

---

# 🛑 Anti‑Lost Rules

1. One phase at a time
2. Never skip exit criteria
3. No Redis without justification
4. No invisible systems
5. Write notes after each phase

---

## 🧭 Success Definition

This project is successful if:

* You can explain **why** each system exists
* You understand trade-offs
* You feel confident designing real-time backends

Not if:

* The UI looks perfect
* Everything is hyper-optimized

---

> **Reminder**: Completion beats perfection. Learning beats polish.
